# React Chess Portfolio App

## Overview  
A React-based chess application showcasing integration of popular chess libraries (react-chess, chess.js, and Stockfish) with custom React components and UI features. This project highlights my skills in React development, state management, and third-party library integration.

## Getting Started  
Clone the repo and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-chess.git
cd react-chess
npm install
